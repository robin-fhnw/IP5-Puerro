Showcase project to have a structured research approach.
It simulates an interactions between a developer and a customer.

- **Customer**: wants an easy to use and modern web application
- **Developer**: wants to develop the application as simple as possible

Huerto is about managing a vegetable garden. In each iteration (season), the customer has new requriements.
